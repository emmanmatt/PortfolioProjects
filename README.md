In a fast-evolving pandemic it is not a simple matter to identify the countries that are most successful in making progress against it. 
For a comprehensive assessment, we track the impact of the pandemic across our publication and we built country profiles for 207 countries to study in depth the statistics on the coronavirus pandemic for every country in the world.
